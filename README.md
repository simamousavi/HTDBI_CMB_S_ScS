# HTDBI_CMB_S_ScS

Here I provided ScS-S data from 2008 to 2018 for the event station pairs at epicentral distances between 60 to 75. Please refere to Hauser et al. (2008) for the rest of the data.

The second file is the shear wave velocity model file which is presented in Fig.9a in revised Mousavi et al. (2021)
